xsd 
- XML Schema Definition defines how request and response should look like. What kind of structure should they have. 
What are the valid values for each of the elements inside the request.
- We can use xsd in future to check if the request which is coming in from external systems are valid
- Also, xsd can be included in the WSDL, that can be shared with our customers who can use this xsd to understand how to create XML request
- XSD can be given to client, they will know what is the request structure and provide request accordingly.
- communication between service consumer and service provider.

endpoint
- something that receives the request, processes it, and sends a response back

Steps for setup (right approach)
-define xml
-define xsd
-configuration for spring web services
-generate wsdl
-ready to execute request

Spring web services will generate wsdl for us
- we will configure spring web services to use course-details.xsd to generate courses.wsdl

Soap web service client
- Wizdler

Different parts of WSDL
- types : It defines all the different elements. Defines the stuff present inside the schema. Exactly what we defined in XSD. Defines the XML structures we are going to use.
- messages : It defines what are the request and the responses.
- portType : It defines the interface i.e. what are the operations that are available. Defines all the different operations provided by the web service.
- binding : Maps the operations to how we are exposing them i.e. Soap over http or soap over mq. Defines the implementation. We define style (document/RPC) and transport.
- service : what is the location / url? How are the clients going to use this service?

Security with WS-Security
(WS-Security is a set of specifications which try to provide security around our SOAP based web services)
(WS-Security is transport independent)
- Authentication
- Digital Signatures
- Certificates

- Implementation of WS-Security -> XWSS - XML and Web Services Security
- Security Policy
- XwsSecurityInterceptor
(XwsSecurityInterceptor will intercept all the SOAP web service requests that are coming in to our web service and 
checks whether it is secure, eg. user id and password)
